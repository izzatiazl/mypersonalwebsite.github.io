<p>I enter this University Technology of Mara branch Kedah and studied here from 2018 to 2021. This university is located in Merbok, Sungai Petani, Kedah. I had a challenging experience after entering university. I learned to be patient even though there are many problems to deal with. I learned to solve my own problems and I started independently after I entered university. I learned timely, sending assignments at a set time. I have many good friends and always help me if I get stuck or need help. I have a very good and easy-to-approach lecturer if i need their help. </p>
